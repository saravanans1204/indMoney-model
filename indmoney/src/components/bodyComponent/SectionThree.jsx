        <h1>Cipla share price: Reasons for decline</h1>
        <p><span>Us Regulator Observations:</span> One of 
        the major reasons that has caused the decline in the
        Cipla share price over the past month is due to the observations 
        made by the US regulators against the company’s plant in Pithampur. 
        The regulator found eight observations against the plant, which 
        contributes about 5% of its total revenues and 15% of its operating 
        profits.Notably, this has caused an adverse effect on the Cipla share
            price.</p>
        
            <p><span>Product Launch Delays:</span> The US regulator observations have continued 
            to affect the Cipla share price negatively in recent times. Due to these 
            observations, the company is facing delay in some of its key product launches 
            like its oncology product gAbraxane. This has affected the smooth operations 
            for the pharma company and has put pressure on its share price.</p>


            <p><span>Weak Results:</span> Cipla’s performance for the Oct-Dec 22 period came 
            in below expectations. The company reported a yearly rise of 10% in its net 
            profits to Rs 801 crores, which came in below the expectations of the analyst 
            community’s figure of Rs 880 crores. Further, the company’s yearly revenue growth
            of just 6% to Rs 5,810 crores also missed the analysts’ expectations of Rs 6,100 
            crores. Thus, disappointing results have also been a major factor in Cipla’s 
            share price decline in recent times.</p>
